LAB 3 DESCRIPTION
=================
In this lab, you will create a simple weather app using Ajax
to access a free weather RESTful Web Service. You will need
to study the API documentation to come up with the endpoint
URL that will be used to access the resource. The endpoint
will return JSON which you will use to populate the various
weather elements in the application.

============
INSTRUCTIONS
============
1. Fork this project to your REPL.it account

2. All your JavaScript should go inside the script.js file.

3. Study the HTML. You will notice the elements that hold
   weather information have already been defined for you
   along with id attributes. Make note of the elements and
   refer to the table below for the ids and what weather element
   should go there.

4. The API documentation for the Open Weather service can be found at:

   https://openweathermap.org/current

   The app uses ZIP codes to return results, look in the documentation
   for the "By Zip Code" section to see an example of what the endpoint
   URL should look like. You will need an "appid" query string argument
   appended to the URL for the call to work. The API endpoint and appid is:

   Endpoint: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather
   Appid: 000c53231273df2ac9323e70eee830d4

   Use your web browser to test the endpoint. Mozilla Firefox works
   best since it can format JSON nicely for you to read. You can also
   use the free REQBIN service for testing: https://reqbin.com/

   You will also need to return the results in imperial units. You can
   append the units=imperial query string argument for this.

5. The endpoint returns JSON. You can use the jQuery $.getJSON()
   Ajax method to invoke the API. Check the Ajax reference for
   code samples.

6. Once you have the JSON as an object, use the jQuery DOM manipulation
   functions to write the weather data to the DOM. (text() or html())
   Use the fadeIn and fadeOut effect to give the weather elements a nice
   visual effect on each update. You will also have to set the weather icon
   using jQuery's functions. Clear the Zip code text box after a successful
   update.

7. Extra Credit (10pts)
   Add error checking to make sure the Zip code entered is found and contains
   results. You will have to study the documentaion and test the API to see what
   to check for.
